Hello, this is my first public repository. And I'm happy to share it with you!

My name is Ates and I am a grad student at UConn MSBAPM Program and this is my second semester.

This semester I'm learning about advanced project management,
Git & Github for full version
Data visualization and interprating data.

I’ve learned that git doesn’t forget… even when I wish it would.
